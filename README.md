# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

During this project, our main goal is to help Becks, a data scientist from a nonprofit foundation called Alphabet Soup analyze which of all the donations they have given in order to help the environment are used effectively and have actually fulfilled their purpose. This question has appeared since there are some contracts that are not been fulfilled where the other party just takes the money and leave. In order to avoid this to keep happening in the future, we are going to help Becks develop a program that identifies which companies are worth investing in and having contracts with, and the perfect tool we have decided to use for this analysis is a deep learning neural network.

## Results

After using the deep learning neural network to analyze different data information such as application type, affiliation, organization, status, income, and more, we have gathered the following information about the different layers and neurons using functions like ReLU and Sigmoid.

## Summary

Unfortunately, even by running an analysis with the deep learning neural network, we weren't able to get the expected positive result due to the low level of accuracy. Another supervised machine learning model we recommend using for this analysis that can give better results is Random Forest Classifier since it can combine and analyze information in a faster and more accurate way.
